### Spartan Racing 2022-2023 Drag Reduction System (DRS)

A repo containing documentation and resources for development of the DRS system.

#### What is DRS? 
DRS is an active aero system that can reduce the drag generated by the rear wing of the car by opening a mechanically controlled flap located in the center of the wing face. When open, the central flap allows airflow to stream through the wing instead of forcing the air upwards and over the wing. This reduction in drag increases the car's top speed when accelerating on straight sections of the course. 

In Formula 1 racing, a driver can only activate DRS under specific racing conditions, namely that they are in a DRS zone and that they are within 1 second of the car they are looking to overtake. By activating DRS and reducing the total drag, a driver looking to pass is able to gain a slight speed advantage over the leading car, making it easier for them to complete the pass. (This article covers the basics of DRS in F1 racing and also touches on the history of the system.)[https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/what-is-drs-f1-how-does-it-work/10307184/] For our purposes in SAE formula 1, there are no restrictions that dictate when a driver is able to engage DRS; this means that it is up to us to determine how to optimize our DRS usage. 


#### DRS Operation
![DRS State Diagram](/images/drsStateDiagram.png)
The DRS system currently has four modes available
- Disengaged -> DRS is permanently disengaged
- Engaged -> DRS is permanently engaged
- Manual -> The driver triggers DRS by pressing a button on the steering wheel. DRS will remain active until the driver releases the button
- Auto -> The VCU drives the state of DRS depending on the readings from sensor inputs. Last season, the combustion car used steering angle, wheel speed, slip ratio, throttle, and brake pressure sensors to determine if DRS should be engaged. The sensor inputs were compared to predeterminied, static threshholds based on the data recorded from previous cars. 

TODO
- 3 port solenoid information / signal management
- Pneumatic actuator information
- Potential ideas for improvement
